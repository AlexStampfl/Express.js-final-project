# Express.js Final Project

### Description
This is my Express.js final project for the fifth semester class advanced web programming.
This projct utilizes Express.js, handlebars, websockets(socketio), CRUD APIs which connects to a mongodb database. The table which displays the database content is a boostrap table. On the last tab there is a drag and drop table game.

### How to Run the Program
In Visual Studio Code, open the terminal. You can use either 'nodemon' - but you have to install nodemon first in order to use it. Or you can use 'node index.js' which then displays the localhost port. Click that localhost link to open up the project in the browser.
